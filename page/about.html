                Guess the colours.<br>
                In Beginne, you wil play 4 possibles colours and 10 attempts.<br>
                In Intermediate, you will have 5 colours to choose from and 8 attempts.<br>
                In Advanced, you will have 6 colours to combine and 6 attempts.<br>
                With the available colours you must try combinations until you find the solution.<br>
                When you press the check button you will se how many colours<br>
                you have found in the correct spot (marked with purple balls)<br>
                and how many colours you go right, but in the wrong spot (marked with white balls).<br>
                <br>
                Good luck!
